## Local network
Local networks come in all sizes. 

They can range from simple networks consisting of two computers, to networks connecting hundreds of thousands of devices. 
`Networks installed in small offices, or homes and home offices, are referred to as small office/home office (SOHO) networks`. SOHO networks let you share resources such as printers, documents, pictures, and music, between a few local users.

Business and SOHO networks usually provide a shared connection to the internet. `The internet is considered a "network of networks" because it is literally made up of thousands of local networks that are connected to each other`.

###### Small Home Networks
Small home networks connect a few computers to each other and to the internet.

###### Small Office and Home Office Networks
The SOHO network allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a corporate network, or access centralised, shared resources.

###### Medium to Large Networks

Medium to large networks, such as those used by corporations and schools, can have many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts.

###### World Wide Networks

The internet is a network of networks that connects hundreds of millions of computers worldwide.

## Mobile Devices

#### Smartphone
Smartphones are able to connect to the internet from almost anywhere. Smartphones combine the functions of many different products together, such as a telephone, camera, GPS receiver, media player, and touch screen computer.

#### Tablet

Tablets, like smartphones, also have the functionality of multiple devices. With the additional screen size, they are ideal for watching videos and reading magazines or books. With on-screen keyboards, 
users are able to do many of the things they used to do on their laptop computer, such as composing emails or browsing the web.

#### Smartwatch
A smartwatch can connect to a smartphone to provide the user with alerts and messages. Additional functions, such as heart rate monitoring and counting steps, like a pedometer, can help people who are wearing the device to track their health.

#### Smart Glasses

A wearable computer in the form of glasses, such as Google Glass, contains a tiny screen that displays information to the wearer in a similar fashion to the Head-Up Display (HUD) of a fighter pilot. A small touch pad on the side allows the user to navigate menus while still being able to see through the smart glasses.


## Connected Home Devices

Many of the things in your home can also be connected to the internet so that they can be monitored and configured remotely.

#### Security System

Many of the items in a home, such as security systems, lighting, and climate controls, can be monitored and configured remotely using a mobile device.

#### Appliances

Household appliances such as refrigerators, ovens, and dishwashers can be connected to the internet. This allows the homeowner to power them on or off, monitor the status of the appliance, and also be alerted to preset conditions, such as when the temperature in the refrigerator rises above an acceptable level.

#### Smart TV

A smart TV can be connected to the internet to access content without the need for TV service provider equipment. Also, a smart TV can allow a user to browse the web, compose email, or display video, audio, or photos stored on a computer.

#### Gaming Console

Gaming consoles can connect to the internet to download games and play with friends online.

## Other Connected Devices

#### Smart Cars

Many modern cars can connect to the internet to access maps, audio and video content, or information about a destination. They can even send a text message or email if there is an attempted theft or call for assistance in case of an accident. These cars can also connect to smartphones and tablets to display information about the different engine systems, provide maintenance alerts, or display the status of the security system.

#### RFID Tags

Radio frequency identification (RFIDs) tags can be placed in or on objects to track them or monitor sensors for many conditions.

#### Sensors and Actuators

Connected sensors can provide temperature, humidity, wind speed, barometric pressure, and soil moisture data. Actuators can then be automatically triggered based on current conditions. For example, a smart sensor can periodically send soil moisture data to a monitoring station. The monitoring station can then send a signal to an actuator to begin watering. The sensor will continue to send soil moisture data allowing the monitoring station to determine when to deactivate the actuator.

#### Medical Devices

Medical devices such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and hospital monitors provide users or medical professionals with direct feedback or alerts when vital signs are at specific levels.
