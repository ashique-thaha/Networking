## The Bit

We humans can interpret the world using our senses but for computers these are the patterns of zeros and ones, like if a switch is turn on and off it has two states like this we can induce scenarios on cpu to make a pattern of 0 and 1.

Thus for every characters, files , emojis, all have it's own binary representation.Thus computers can process the information we give.

example:
- **Capital letter:** A = 01000001
- **Number:** 9 = 00111001
- **Special character:** # = 00100011

each zeros and ones represent a bit in here.
