After the data is transformed into a series of bits, it must be converted into signals that can be sent across the network media to its destination.

Media refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted. Examples of media are `copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic waves` through the air. 

A signal consists of electrical or optical patterns that are transmitted from one connected device to another. These patterns represent the digital bits (i.e. the data) and travel across the media from source to destination as either a series of pulses of electricity, pulses of light, or radio waves. 

Signals may be converted many times before ultimately reaching the destination, as corresponding media changes between source and destination.

There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks: 

- **Electrical signals -** Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- **Optical signals -** Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- **Wireless signals -** Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.
