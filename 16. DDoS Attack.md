DDoS Attack is a sort of attack conducted by hackers to create a lot of traffic in an application, which will result in the unavailability of service to normal users.

How will DDoS attack seems,  on seeing from the owner's or application's side:
- Slowing down of the application
- A complete outage
- Anomalies or unexplained behaviour of the app

One of the ways that an attacker is able to do a DDoS attack is by sending simultaneous requests to the target server, where not just one computer or a device participate but a collection of them. Hacker gets access to already compromised devices on internet a forms something called BOTNET to perform a DDoS attack.
