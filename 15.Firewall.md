Firewalls or the concept of firewall is really simple that it means, we are going to block tcp ports.

one of the ways computers connect to each other is by having something called TCP ports.

So consider IP address as street number and the port will be the exact location we need to go.

For to access a web service on internet we need to connect to port 80 (http) for https it is port 443.And so for each each function there will be a port to connect.

So the simplest way to secure the traffic that comes to your device is to block unwanted ports on our server.

So imagine there is a scenario where, you have to keep your server's ssh connection alive as you got to do admin tasks on the server. But you are concerned about the general public or hackers connecting to our server via ssh(even if they got credentials some how). The best way to mitigate this issue will be to setup firewall to block ssh connection outside our internal network. 

In this case Firewall will block all tcp port 22 connection excluding the one from the network that we allowed. 

In firewalls we can configure inbound and outbound traffic rules, which essentially means the traffic coming to server or a device(inbound) and traffic going out of the device(outbound).

There are two types of firewall(form):
- Hardware Firewall
- Software Firewall

While hardware firewall protects the entire LAN with bare minimum rules, we can configure software firewall for each minute actions. example, if an adversary get access to our internal database then we might loss a lot of information. But we can configure the software firewalls of these databases to only allow inbound and outbound traffic from internal resources, thus protecting them.

##### Network Firewalls & Application Firewalls

Network Firewalls helps in specifically allowing or disallowing what  ports are or are not allowed.

Application Firewalls can block or allow the communication of a specific application on a  device. Example, we can allow SKYPE while disallowing chrome.

These firewalls understands how the applications communicate and block them accordingly. Blocking/Allowing each ports manually will a lot harder. 

Classes of FireWall:
- SPF(Stateful packet inspection) firewall.
- UTM(Unified Threat Management) firewall.
- NGFW(Next Generation FireWall).

`SPF` became a necessary thing once we started using NAT(Network address translation).When router sends packets to internet it uses External IP. SPF works when we surf on internet and adversaries send their own packets which will be harmful to us. SPF will figure out the legit communication and block other packets.

`UTM` Firewalls used some more smart concepts to firewalls. The firewall already have all the data passed through it. why then just not blocking tcp ports, can't we add antivirus directly to the firewall. This idea lead to UTM firewalls. Not Just Anti virus, Anti spam softwares also can be integrated to UTM Firewalls.

`NGFW` Firewalls is class of firewall built on futuristic vision. This one is extremely secure and costly to implement. This even have IDS integrated. These might be capable of upgrading to it's newer version. just like we upgrade our OS. The core concept is that whatever new technique comes in defence, NGFWs should be able to implement it.


## Circuit level Gateway

Circuit level gateway works on sessions layer, this will inspect the packet header and analyse TCP protocol handshaking between packets to identify the legitimate ones. Only the header of the packet is  checked here, not the content of the packet.


==So How does a circuit level gateway work?==
![Illustration how circuit level gateway works](https://nordlayer.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.nordlayer.com%2Fuploads%2Fillustration_how_circuit_level_gateway_works_ed89fa0fbf.webp&w=1280&q=75)

- When a user initiates a connection to a remote host, **the circuit level gateway sets up a circuit or a virtual connection between the user and the remote host**. 
    
- The circuit level gateway then **monitors the traffic flowing over this circuit, checking whether the traffic belongs to an established connection** and allowing only authorised traffic to pass through.

Validated transmission control protocol or user datagram protocol connections then interact with a destination server on behalf of the client. Otherwise the connection is rejected, terminating the session.

The firewall creates a connection b/w internal and external computers to check the traffic that is passing between them. If the traffic meets the circuit level gateway rules then the traffic can pass through to internal client.

Due to their mode of operation, circuit level gateways determine the safety of an established connection with the help of a virtual connection on behalf of an internal host. This intermediary layer  helps to keep its identity and IP address hidden from the server. In turn, this leaves fewer breadcrumbs that hackers could use.
