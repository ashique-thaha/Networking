The `OSI model` or `open systems interconnection` model is a conceptual framework that is simply used to understand how data is transferred from one node to another.

Each layer has its own functions and it interacts with the next layer for to facilitate communication between devices.

The OSI model provides a structured approach in understanding and designing network architecture and protocols.

Each layer is a set of protocols that is used to make respective functions work correctly. 

`example:` Application layer don't mean application softwares like `chrome` or `firefox` but it defines the protocols to make these applications to work correctly on a network.




##### Application Layer:

Application layer is use by network applications(Applications that use internet) like `safari , Outlook , skype` etc.

This layer have dozens of protocols which make these application's intended function work correctly, 

`example:`
FTP => file transfer
HTTP/s => web surfing
SMTP => mail
Telnet/SSH => remote shell

These protocols together makes application layer work.


##### Presentation Layer 

Presentation layer receives data from application layer.

 - The data given by application layer will be in the form of correctors and numbers. This will be the converted to binary by presentation layer. This process is called `Translation`.

`example:`

conversion of ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) to EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code).

- Another function of presentation layer is called `Data compression`. In this part presentation layer reduces the bits that are used to represent the original data. This can be lossy or lossless.

`scenario:`
A 5 mb data can be stripped to 2 mb during transmission and can be converted back to original size, then data transmission will be a lot faster. This will be helpful for functions like video and audio streaming.

- To maintain the integrity of data, the  data will be `encrypted`, this is in-fact another function of presentation layer. The encryption will be done by sender's side and decryption will be done by receiver's side.The layer uses `SSL` for this function.

So in summary: Presentation layer does three different functions, `Translation` , `Data compression` , `Encryption/Decryption`


##### Session layer

Suppose you hired some helpers for a party that you organised to do each function. Like, setting up, assisting, cleaning, closing etc.

Session layer helps in setting up and managing connections, enabling sending and receiving of data, followed by termination of connections.

The helpers for sessions layer are called `APIs`(Application programming interface).

`Netbios` or Network basic Input/Output system is one such API, that facilitates this type of communication.

Just before a session, or a connection is established to the server, the server performs a process called `authentication`.

Authentication is  the process of verifying who you are, usually it is done by using a username or a password.

Once authenticated, a connection is established between the device and the server.

After that `authorisation` will be done, ie checking if the user have permission to access a particular resource.

Also session layer keeps track of files that are being downloaded. for example a webpage contains text,  images etc. Text and images are stored on the web server as separate files.


So when you request for a web page in a web browser, these files will  be downloaded separately. each of these files will be received in the form of data packets.

Session layer keeps track of which data packet belongs to which file and also where these received data packets go, in this case it is web browser. All these actions together is called `session management`.

So session layer helps in `Authentication`, `Authorisation` and `session management`.


##### Transport layer

Transport layer ensures the reliability of communication through `Segmentation`, `Flow control` , `Error control` .



`Segmentation:`

Data received from sessions layer is divided into small data units called segments.

Each segments contains a source and destination port number and a sequence number. 

Port number helps to direct each segment to the each application. Sequence number helps to reassemble segments in its correct order. To form correct order at the receiver.


`Flow Control:`

In Flow control the transport layer controls the amount of data being transmitted. 

Suppose there is a server which is capable of transmitting data at a rate of 100Mbps. But the device that connects to this server, can only receive the data upto 10Mbps. 

If the server start to send data at it's speed then the  receiving end will be incapable of receiving the whole data as it cannot keep up with the server.

To mitigate this issue user can request server to slow down to 10Mbps using Transport layer.

Similarly, if the speed of data transmission of server is less than expected user can request for increase in transmission speed, with the help of transport layer.


`Error control:`

if some data doesn't arrive at the intended destination, Transport layer uses automatic repeat request schemes to retransmit the lost or corrupted data.

checksum is added to each segment to find the missing one.

Protocols like TCP(transmission control protocol) or UDP(user datagram protocol) are  used  in Transport Layer.

So functions of Transport layer are: `Segmentation` , `Flow control` , `Error control` , `Connection oriented and connection less protocol`.

##### Network Layer:

Transport layer passes data segments to the network layer.

Network layer works for the transmission of the received data segments from one computer to another located in two different networks.

Data units in Network layer are called packets. This is the layer in which routers reside.

`Functions of network layer are: Logical Addressing, Path determination, Routing` etc.

Ip addressing done in network layer is called `Logical addressing`. Every computer in a network has a unique ip address. Network layer assigns sender's and receivers ip address in a network segment to form an ip packet. Ip address are assigned to make sure that it reaches the intended destination.

`Routing` is moving data packets from source to destination. it is based on the logical address format of IPv4 or IPv6.

suppose, computer A is connected to network 1 and computer B is connected to network 2.

from computer B we have requested to access facebook.com and now there will be a reply to computer B from facebook.com 's server in the form of a data packet.

in that data packet the sender's and receiver's ip address will be added. Here in this case consider the subnet mask as 225.225.225.0 then it will first reach the network and then it will reach the device.

So based on ip address and mask routing decisions are made in a computer network.

`Path determination:`

A computer can be connected to an internet server or another computer in several ways. Choosing the best possible path for data delivery from source to destination is called path determination.

For to facilitate this layer 3 uses protocols like, 
- OSPF(Open shortest path first) 
- BGP(Border gateway protocol) 
- IS-IS(Intermediate system to intermediate system)

##### Data link layer

Data link layer receives data packet from network layer. Data packets contains ip of sender and receiver.

There are two types of addressing:  
- Logical Addressing
- Physical Addressing

`Logical addressing` is done in Network layer, where ip address of sender and receiver is added in a segment to form `data packet`.

`Physical addressing` is done in Data link layer where mac address of sender and receiver is also added to the existing data packet. Now it is called `frame`.

Data link layer is embedded in NIC(network interface card ) as software. This will help in data transfer via a local media.

Local media in here means,
- copper wire
- optical cable
- radio signals

Data link layer performs two basic functions,
- Allows upper layer of OSI model to access media using techniques such as framing
- It controls how data is placed and received from media using techniques such as media access control ans error detection.


`scenario:`
consider two different hosts communicating with each other, both are connected to different networks, network A and Network B respectively.

As they are connected with two different network the protocol used to communicate will be IP(Internet Protocol).

Here, Device A is connected to router via an ethernet cable. Router R1 and R2 are connected to internet.

Device B is connected to router via a wireless link.

Now, Device A want to connect to Device B, based on the medium used to connect the device to the router data link layer adds a head and tail to the IP packet and make it a frame(Ethernet frame in this case ).

Now this Frame will be send to Router A and router will decapsulate the frame to an IP packet and add some head and tail and encapsulate it to a frame again.

Now the Frame will pass through internet and reach Router B . Router B will decapsulate it and add head and tail. Then encapsulate it again to form a wireless data link frame.

Device B will receive this wireless data link frame, decapsulate it and forward IP packet to network layer. 

Finally data arrives at application layer. Application layer protocols make the data visible on the screen.

Here we can see that data link layer provides data access to network layer and then to application layer this means that Data link layer helps in Accessing the media.


`Controls how data is placed and received from the media:` The technique used to get the Frame on and off the media is called Media access control. There may be a number of devices connected to a common media, if two or more devices connected on the same media send data at the same time, there may be a possibility  of collision of message.

To avoid this situation data link layer keeps an eye to check when the media is free and permits to send data accordingly. This is called CSMA(carrier sense multiple access).

So data link layer with its media access control methods controls data transmission.
Tail of the Frame contains bits which helps to identify errors.

##### Physical Layer

We have seen that in Data link layer  packet is converted to Frame by adding Head and tail.

This is basically a series of binary. Physical layer converts this binary into signals and send it to media.

And at the receiver's side  the signal will converted to binary and then send to data link layer as Frame and then to network layer.

Finally the packet will reach application layer where the data will be visible to the user.
