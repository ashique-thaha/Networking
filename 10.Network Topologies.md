## Mesh Topology 

Mesh topology is where each and every device or node is interconnected with every other node in the network.

This topology is mostly used where the reliability on the network should be high, robust and fault tolerant.

Since each node is connected to every other node, multiple paths exist between any two nodes. This redundancy ensures that if one link or node fails, alternative paths can be used to maintain connectivity

Mesh networks can be highly scalable, as adding new nodes typically involves establishing connections with existing nodes.There will only be less need of reconfiguration.

Even if one or more nodes or links fail, the network can still maintain connectivity by rerouting traffic along alternative paths.

Mesh networks can be complex to design, implement, and manage, especially as the number of nodes increases. The cost of implementing a mesh network can also be higher compared to other topologies due to the 
need for more hardware and cabling.


1. **Types of Mesh Topology**:
    
    - **Full Mesh**: In a full mesh topology, every node is directly connected to every other node. This provides the highest level of redundancy but requires a large number of connections, making it impractical for large networks.
    - **Partial Mesh**: In a partial mesh topology, only certain nodes are directly connected to one another, while others may rely on indirect paths through intermediate nodes. This reduces the number of connections and can be more practical for larger networks.


##### **Applications**:

- **Critical Infrastructure**: Mesh networks are commonly used in critical infrastructure such as telecommunications, power distribution, and military networks where reliability and fault tolerance are paramount.

-  **Wireless Mesh Networks**: In wireless environments, mesh networks can be deployed to extend coverage and improve reliability, particularly in areas where traditional infrastructure is impractical or unavailable.

## Bus Topology

A bus topology is a type of network topology in which all nodes are connected to a single communication line, called the bus.


1. **Single Communication Line (Bus)**: In a bus topology, all nodes, including computers, servers, and peripherals, are connected to a central cable (the bus). This cable serves as the communication medium through which data is transmitted.
    
2. **Terminators**: Both ends of the bus cable must be terminated with terminators to prevent signal reflection and ensure proper signal transmission along the bus.
    
3. **Broadcast Communication**: In a bus topology, when a node sends data onto the bus, it is broadcast to all other nodes on the network. However, only the intended recipient processes the data, while the others ignore it.
    
4. **Collisions**: Since all nodes share the same communication medium, collisions can occur when two or more nodes attempt to transmit data simultaneously. Collisions can degrade network performance and efficiency, especially as the number of nodes increases.
    
5. **Simple Installation and Maintenance**: Bus topology is relatively simple to install and requires less cabling compared to other topologies like mesh or star. However, troubleshooting and locating faults can be challenging, especially in larger networks.

6. **Limitations**:
    
    - **Scalability**: Bus topology is not highly scalable. As more nodes are added to the network, the bus can become congested, leading to performance issues.
    - **Single Point of Failure**: The central bus cable represents a single point of failure. If the bus cable is damaged or severed, the entire network can become inaccessible.
    - **Limited Performance**: Bus topology may suffer from bandwidth limitations and network congestion, particularly in larger networks with high data traffic.

7. **Applications**:
    
    - Bus topology is suitable for small networks with a limited number of nodes, such as small office or home networks.
    - It's also used in scenarios where simplicity and cost-effectiveness are prioritised over performance and scalability.


## Star Topology

A star topology is a common type of network topology in which each node (such as computers, printers, or servers) is connected directly to a central device, typically a switch or a hub.


1. **Central Device**: In a star topology, all nodes are connected directly to a central device, such as a switch or a hub. This central device manages the communication between nodes by receiving data from one node and transmitting it to the intended destination node.
    
2. **Point-to-Point Connection**: Each node in a star topology has a dedicated point-to-point connection to the central device. This means that the communication between nodes does not interfere with the communication between other nodes, enhancing network efficiency and reducing the likelihood of collisions.
    
3. **Isolation of Nodes**: In a star topology, if a node fails or experiences issues, it typically does not affect the operation of other nodes in the network. This isolation of nodes makes it easier to troubleshoot and maintain the network compared to other topologies like bus or ring.
    
4. **Scalability**: Star topology is highly scalable, as additional nodes can be easily added to the network by connecting them to the central device. This scalability makes star topology suitable for both small and large networks.
    
5. **Central Point of Failure**: Despite its advantages, a star topology has a single point of failureâ€”the central device. If the central device fails, the entire network may become inaccessible. To mitigate this risk, redundant central devices or backup systems can be implemented.
    
6. **Managed Switches**: In modern star topologies, switches are commonly used as the central devices. Managed switches offer advanced features such as VLAN support, Quality of Service (QoS) prioritisation, and security enhancements, allowing for better network management and performance optimisation.
    
7. **Applications**:
    
    - Star topology is widely used in Ethernet LAN (Local Area Network) environments, including office networks, campus networks, and home networks.
    - It is also commonly used in WAN (Wide Area Network) environments, where multiple LANs are interconnected using routers and switches in a hierarchical star topology.


## Tree Topology


In a tree topology, nodes are arranged hierarchically, resembling a tree structure with a root node at the top and branches extending downward.

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Tree topology features a hierarchical structure with a root node at the top, branching out into multiple levels of nodes.
    
2. **Root Node**: The root node serves as the central point of the network, often connecting to multiple secondary nodes, which in turn may connect to additional nodes.
    
3. **Scalability**: Tree topology is relatively scalable, allowing for the expansion of the network by adding branches and nodes as needed.
    
4. **Centralised Management**: The root node typically plays a central role in network management and communication, although each branch may have its own local management structure.
    
5. **Reliability**: While tree topology offers redundancy at higher levels, it may suffer from single points of failure if the root node or critical branches fail.
    
6. **Applications**: Tree topology is commonly used in wide area networks (WANs), such as hierarchical corporate networks, where multiple branch offices are connected to a central headquarters.


## Ring Topology:


In a ring topology, each node is connected to exactly two other nodes, forming a closed loop. 

1. **Closed Loop Structure**: In a ring topology, data travels in one direction around the loop, passing through each node until it reaches its destination or returns to the source.
    
2. **Equal Access**: Each node in a ring topology has equal access to the network and an equal opportunity to transmit data.
    
3. **Simple Structure**: Ring topology is relatively simple in structure compared to other topologies, such as mesh or tree.
    
4. **Single Point of Failure**: Ring topology is susceptible to a single point of failure. If one node or connection fails, it can disrupt the entire network.
    
5. **Token Passing**: To prevent collisions and manage data transmission, ring networks often use a token passing mechanism, where only the node holding the token is allowed to transmit data at any given time.
    
6. **Applications**: Ring topology was commonly used in early LAN technologies like Token Ring networks. While it's less prevalent today, it still finds applications in specific industrial environments or legacy systems.
