	
A P2P application allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication. In this model, every client is a server and every server is a client. 

P2P applications require that each end device provide a user interface and run a background service.

Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralised, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralised directory. 

In a hybrid system, each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another peer.

`An example to this will be instant messaging apps like whatsapp, messenger etc.`

## Multiple Roles in the Network

A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to one or many clients.

Additionally, a single computer can run multiple types of server software. In a home or small business, it may be necessary for one computer to act as a file server, a web server, and an email server.

A single computer can also run multiple types of client software. There must be client software for every service required. With multiple clients installed, a host can connect to multiple servers at the same time. For example, a user can check email and view a web page while instant messaging and listening to internet radio.
